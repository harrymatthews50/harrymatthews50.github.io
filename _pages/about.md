I am a bioinformatician and data scientist with a specialty in multivariate statistics, including the statistical analysis of shapes from medical images. I completed my PhD at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne Australia and was for four years a postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory for Imaging Genetics at KU Leuven, Belgium. 

During my PhD I became fascinated by the ability of multivariate statistics to unveil complex patterns in data and have since sought to expand the toolkits available to clinicians and researchers: I developed and maintain the 'python_shape_stats' toolbox for the statistical analysis of dense surface meshes and the '3DGrowthCurves' toolbox for the assessment of facial abnormality from 3D facial photographs. I have authored and co-authored over 40 research publications in diverse fields from medicine to data science to anthropology.
